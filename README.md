🇨🇦 Canada Budget 2025: Economic Impact Simulator

Overview

This is a single-page web application designed to visualize and interactively model the key fiscal and economic components of the Canadian Federal Budget 2025 ("Canada Strong"). The application focuses specifically on the government's dual strategy: fiscal discipline through spending reviews and generational capital investment to drive long-term productivity and reduce reliance on the U.S. economy.

Key Features

The simulator is divided into three main analytical sections:

Fiscal Discipline:

Displays the projected $78.3 billion deficit for 2025-26.

Highlights the crucial $60.0 billion five-year savings goal from the Comprehensive Expenditure Review.

Visually tracks the progress toward balancing day-to-day operational spending.

Capital Investment Simulation:

Displays the committed $280 Billion in public capital investment over five years.

Shows the target of catalyzing $1.0 Trillion in total public and private investment.

Features the Investment Multiplier Slider (see Usage below).

Simulated 2030 Real GDP Effect:

A dynamic gauge that shows the predicted change in GDP growth by 2030.

The forecast is driven by the user's input on the Investment Multiplier, illustrating that the 3.5% GDP boost goal is highly dependent on successful, timely project execution.

Trade Diversification Strategy:

Outlines the challenge of US Trade Reliance in the face of escalating protectionism.

Details the three key solutions: The Trade Diversification Corridors Fund ($5B), EDC Export Support ($25B), and investments in Critical Minerals Sovereignty.

Usage: How to Run the Simulation

The application is entirely contained within the index.html file and requires no server-side setup.

Open the File: Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

Adjust the Multiplier: Use the "Simulate Investment Success (Multiplier)" slider in the Capital Investment card.

Low Multiplier (e.g., 0.5x): Represents poor project execution, delays, and failure to attract significant private co-investment. This results in a minimal or negative GDP boost.

Medium Multiplier (e.g., 1.0x): Represents moderate success where public spending equals private catalytic spending.

High Multiplier (e.g., 1.5x - 2.0x): Represents high execution success, efficient delivery of nation-building projects, and massive private sector buy-in, leading to the maximum projected 3.5% Real GDP boost by 2030.
