🇨🇦 Canada Budget 2025: Economic Impact Simulator (Macro Policy Stress-Test)

Overview

This is a dynamic, single-page web application designed to stress-test the key strategic goals and inherent risks of the Canadian Federal Budget 2025 ("Canada Strong"). The model allows users to manipulate seven independent fiscal, monetary, and external risk variables to analyze the Budget's ultimate success in boosting productivity and reducing reliance on the U.S. economy.

Key Features & Modeled Policy Areas

The application is structured to visualize the complex interdependencies between the government's fiscal policy and external economic forces:

Policy Area

Key Slider/Variable

Outcome Tracked

I. Growth & Productivity

Investment Multiplier (Execution Risk) & PR Immigration Levels

2030 Real GDP Boost (Target: 3.5%), Unemployment Rate

II. Fiscal & Monetary Credibility

Fiscal Discipline Success (Savings Rate), Monetary Policy Stance (Interest Rates), & Cost-Push Inflation

Debt-to-GDP Ratio, Simulated CPI Inflation

III. External Resilience

External Trade Tension (U.S. Risk) & Housing Delivery Success

Trade Drag on GDP, Trade Diversification Goal progress, 5-Year Housing Target

Key Metrics Tracked:

Real GDP Boost: A dynamic gauge showing the net effect of growth drivers (investment, immigration) versus drags (trade tension, high rates).

Simulated CPI Inflation: Reflects the tension between demand-pull (fiscal stimulus) and cost-push (commodity shock) pressures, benchmarked against the 2.0% BoC Target.

Debt-to-GDP: Tracks the stability of this fiscal anchor, influenced by both savings success and the cost of servicing debt (interest rates).

Unemployment Rate: Reflects job market stability based on the combination of investment-driven growth, trade risk, and labour supply (immigration).

Usage: Running the Policy Stress-Test

The application is entirely self-contained within the index.html file. Simply open the file in any modern web browser to start the simulation.

Use the seven dedicated sliders to run customized scenarios:

Investment Multiplier: Models the efficiency of the $280B public investment in catalyzing private capital. (High values = better GDP).

Fiscal Discipline Success: Models how much of the $60B in savings is actually realized through the Expenditure Review. (High values = better Debt-to-GDP).

External Trade Tension (Risk): Models the severity of global or U.S. trade friction. (High values = higher GDP Drag, worse outcomes).

Housing Delivery Success: Models the timely execution of housing and infrastructure projects. (High values = more homes built).

Monetary Policy Stance: Models the central bank's interest rate policy (Hawkish rates suppress investment and increase debt cost).

Cost-Push Inflation Pressure: Models external inflationary shocks (e.g., commodity price spikes) independent of domestic demand.

PR Immigration Levels: Models the government's long-term permanent resident intake (High values increase growth potential but can add short-term friction).

By testing various combinations (e.g., maximum Investment Multiplier with high Trade Tension), you can identify the most critical risks to the Budget's overall success.
